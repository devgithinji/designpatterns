# Design Patterns

## Creational Design Patterns

### Builder pattern

it used to create complex objects step by step

### Prototype pattern

focuses on creating objects by cloning or copying existing instances known as prototypes

rather than creating objects from scatch. This method is useful when the cost of creating

a new instance of an object is relatively high and you want to avoid the overhead of initalizing

athe object from scratch
